## hair transplant in Raipur

Hair transplant in Raipur is a surgical procedure where hair follicles are transplanted from a donor area to a balding or thinning area on the scalp. This procedure is typically done under local anesthesia and can be performed using techniques like Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) or Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT). The transplanted hair follicles will continue to grow naturally, providing a permanent solution to hair loss. It is important to consult with a qualified and experienced dermatologist or hair transplant surgeon in Raipur to discuss the best approach for your specific needs and expectations.
