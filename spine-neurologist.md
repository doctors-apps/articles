## Spine Neurologist

A spine neurologist specializes in treating disorders of the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. They evaluate and diagnose conditions such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and nerve compression, and develop treatment plans that may include medication, physical therapy, injections, or surgery. Surgical procedures performed by spine neurologists aim to relieve pressure on the nerves, repair injured spinal structures, and restore function. These procedures may involve minimally invasive techniques or more invasive surgeries depending on the specific condition and the patient's overall health. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, improve mobility, and enhance quality of life for patients with spine-related neurological issues.
