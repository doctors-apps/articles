##IVF Treatment In Islam

In Islam, the permissibility of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment can vary among different scholars and interpretations. Some Islamic scholars consider IVF permissible if it involves the genetic material of a married couple and does not involve third-party donors. However, others may have reservations or restrictions on the procedure due to ethical concerns surrounding the creation and handling of embryos outside of the womb. It is recommended for individuals considering IVF treatment in Islam to consult with knowledgeable scholars or Islamic ethicists to ensure compliance with religious principles and guidelines.
