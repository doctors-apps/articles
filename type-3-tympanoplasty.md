## Type 3 Tympanoplasty

Type 3 tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure performed to repair a defect in the eardrum, known as a tympanic membrane perforation, that extends to the malleus (one of the middle ear bones). During the procedure, the surgeon uses tissue grafts to close the perforation and reconstruct the hearing mechanisms of the middle ear, including the ossicles. Type 3 tympanoplasty is typically recommended for larger perforations that involve damage to the malleus and can help restore hearing function and prevent recurrent ear infections. The success rate of the procedure depends on various factors, including the size and location of the perforation, the patient's overall health, and post-operative care.

1) Type 3 tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure aimed at repairing a perforation of the eardrum along with reconstruction of the ossicular chain in the middle ear.
2) The surgery involves creating a graft or flap of tissue to cover the hole in the eardrum and reconstructing the small bones in the middle ear to restore hearing function.
3) Type 3 tympanoplasty is typically performed under general anesthesia in a hospital setting by an otolaryngologist, or ear, nose, and throat specialist.
4) The procedure begins with the surgeon making an incision behind the ear to access the middle ear and eardrum.
5) The perforation in the eardrum is then carefully cleaned and repaired using a tissue graft, often taken from the patient's own body or a synthetic material.
6) The surgeon then assesses the condition of the ossicular chain and may repair or reconstruct these tiny bones to improve sound conduction.
7) Once the repair is complete, the incision behind the ear is closed with sutures, and the patient is monitored post operatively for any complications.
8) Recovery from type 3 tympanoplasty typically involves a period of rest and restriction of physical activity to allow for proper healing.

9) Patients may also need to avoid getting water in the ear or flying in airplanes during the initial phase of recovery to prevent complications.
10) Follow up appointments with the surgeon are necessary to monitor healing progress and assess any changes in hearing function. Overall, type 3 tympanoplasty is a well established surgical procedure that can help restore hearing and improve quality of life for individuals with eardrum perforations and middle ear issues.
