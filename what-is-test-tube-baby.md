##What Is Test Tube Baby

Test tube baby, also known as in vitro fertilization (IVF), is a fertility treatment where an egg is fertilized by sperm in a laboratory dish. The resulting embryo is then transferred into the woman's uterus to establish a pregnancy. This procedure is commonly used for couples struggling with infertility due to various reasons, such as blocked fallopian tubes, low sperm count, or unexplained infertility. IVF has helped many couples achieve their dream of having a baby and has revolutionized the field of reproductive medicine.
