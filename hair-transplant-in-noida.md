## Hair Transplant in Noida

Hair transplant in Noida is a surgical procedure that involves the extraction of hair follicles from a donor area, typically the back or sides of the head, and implanting them into areas where hair loss has occurred. This procedure is commonly used to treat male pattern baldness and female hair thinning. The skilled surgeons in Noida use techniques like Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) or Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) to ensure natural-looking results. Patients can expect a permanent solution to hair loss with minimal scarring and downtime, leading to improved self-confidence and appearance post-surgery.
