## Tlif Spine Surgery

Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) spine surgery is a surgical procedure used to treat conditions such as degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis, and spinal stenosis that may be causing back and leg pain. In TLIF surgery, the problematic disc is removed from the spine and replaced with a bone graft to promote fusion between the vertebrae. This helps stabilize the spine and relieve pressure on the nerves, resulting in reduced pain and improved mobility for the patient. The procedure is performed through a small incision in the back, allowing for less tissue disruption and a quicker recovery compared to traditional open surgery methods.
