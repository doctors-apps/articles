## Hair Transplant Clinic in Jaipur

A hair transplant clinic in Jaipur offers a surgical procedure where hair follicles are moved from one part of the body (the donor site) to the balding or thinning areas (the recipient site). This procedure typically involves extracting individual follicles or small groups of follicles from the donor area, usually the back or sides of the scalp, and implanting them into the balding areas. The goal of this treatment is to restore natural-looking hair growth in areas where hair has thinned or been lost. Hair transplant clinics in Jaipur use advanced techniques such as follicular unit transplantation (FUT) or follicular unit extraction (FUE) to achieve optimal results with minimal scarring and downtime for patients.
