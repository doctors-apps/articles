## Beard Transplant Price in India

Beard transplant in India typically costs between INR 50,000 to INR 200,000, depending on factors such as the clinic, the surgeon's expertise, the number of grafts required, and the technique used. This cosmetic procedure involves transplanting hair follicles from a donor area (usually the back of the scalp) to the beard area to create a fuller and more uniform beard. The cost may also vary based on additional services like consultations, post-operative care, and follow-up appointments. It's essential to consult with experienced and reputable surgeons to discuss personalized treatment plans and pricing details.
