## Beard and Hair Transplant

Beard and hair transplant is a surgical procedure aimed at restoring hair growth in areas where it is thinning or absent. This procedure involves removing hair follicles from a donor site (usually the back of the head) and implanting them into the balding or thinning areas of the beard or scalp. The results of beard and hair transplants can be natural-looking and long-lasting, providing patients with increased confidence and a fuller appearance. Before undergoing this procedure, patients should consult with a qualified and experienced transplant surgeon to discuss their expectations, candidacy, and potential risks.
