## Gynecomastia Ultrasound

Gynecomastia ultrasound is a diagnostic imaging test that uses sound waves to examine the breast tissues in males with enlarged breasts. It helps in determining the underlying cause of gynecomastia, which can be attributed to hormonal imbalances, medications, or other health conditions. Treatment options for gynecomastia include surgery, such as liposuction or glandular tissue removal, to reduce the breast size and improve the appearance. The decision to undergo surgery is typically based on the severity of gynecomastia and the individual's overall health and preferences. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider to discuss the most suitable treatment approach for gynecomastia.
