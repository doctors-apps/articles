##Pediatric Orthopedics

Pediatric orthopedics is a specialized branch of medicine focused on the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal issues in children. Treatment may include non-surgical methods such as physical therapy, braces, or medication, but some cases may require surgical intervention. Pediatric orthopedic surgery aims to correct conditions such as scoliosis, limb deformities, fractures, and sports injuries in children, ensuring proper growth and development of their bones and muscles. Surgeons use the latest techniques and technologies to provide safe and effective solutions that help children regain mobility and improve their quality of life.
