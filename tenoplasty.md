## Tenoplasty

Tenoplasty is a surgical procedure performed to repair or reconstruct a tendon that has been damaged or injured. This treatment aims to restore the normal function and stability of the tendon by reattaching or reinforcing it with sutures or grafts. Tenoplasty is commonly performed in cases of tendon rupture, chronic tendinopathy, or other injuries that affect the normal functioning of the tendon. The procedure may involve removing damaged tissue, reshaping the tendon, or using specialized techniques to strengthen the tendon and promote healing. Following tenoplasty, patients typically undergo a period of rehabilitation to regain strength, flexibility, and function in the affected tendon.
