## Liposuction Surgery in Delhi

Liposuction surgery in Delhi is a cosmetic procedure that aims to remove excess fat and reshape specific areas of the body. During the surgery, a small incision is made, and a thin tube called a cannula is inserted to suction out the fat deposits. This procedure is commonly performed in areas like the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, and arms. Liposuction surgery in Delhi is typically performed under local or general anesthesia by skilled plastic surgeons. Patients should maintain a healthy lifestyle post-surgery to ensure long-lasting results and minimize potential risks.
