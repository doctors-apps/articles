## Post Aural Incision

Post-aural incision refers to a surgical technique typically used in otology for access to the middle ear and mastoid region through an incision made behind the ear. This approach allows for better visualization and access to structures in the ear during procedures such as tympanoplasty, mastoidectomy, or cochlear implant surgery. The post-aural incision technique can result in less visible scarring, reduced risk of damage to the facial nerve, and improved cosmetic outcomes compared to other incision methods in ear surgery.

1) Post aural incision is a surgical technique used in otolaryngology (ear, nose, and throat) procedures that involves making an incision behind the ear.
2) This type of incision is commonly used for surgeries such as mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty, and cochlear implantation.
3) The post aural approach provides good exposure to the middle ear and mastoid region, allowing the surgeon to perform intricate procedures.
4) To perform a post aural incision, the surgeon makes a curved incision behind the ear, following the natural creases of the skin for better cosmesis.
5) The incision is carefully placed to minimize scarring and to give the surgeon optimal access to the surgical site.
6) Post aural incisions are typically closed using sutures or surgical staples, and meticulous wound care is essential for proper healing.
7) Patients undergoing surgery with a post aural incision may experience some discomfort and swelling in the area following the procedure.
8) Post operative care may involve keeping the incision site clean and dry, monitoring for signs of infection, and attending follow up appointments with the surgeon.
