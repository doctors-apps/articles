## Hair Transplant in Gurgaon

Hair transplant treatment in Gurgaon involves a surgical procedure where hair follicles are moved from a donor area, typically the back or sides of the head, to the balding or thinning areas. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia and is known for its effectiveness in restoring hair growth in areas affected by baldness or hair loss. Experienced hair transplant specialists in Gurgaon use advanced techniques such as FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction) or FUT (Follicular Unit Transplantation) to achieve natural-looking results. Patients can expect a gradual regrowth of hair in the transplanted areas over several months, with permanent and long-lasting outcomes. If you are considering hair transplant surgery in Gurgaon, it is advisable to consult with a reputable clinic to discuss your options and expectations.
