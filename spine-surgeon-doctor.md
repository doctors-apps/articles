## Spine Surgeon Doctor

A spine surgeon, also known as an orthopedic surgeon specializing in spine surgery, is a medical professional who diagnoses and treats conditions affecting the spine. These conditions may include herniated discs, spinal deformities, spinal fractures, or spinal stenosis. Treatment options range from conservative approaches such as physical therapy and medication to surgical interventions like spinal fusion, discectomy, or laminectomy. The goal of spine surgery is to alleviate pain, improve function, and restore mobility in patients suffering from debilitating spine conditions. Patients undergoing spine surgery are typically evaluated through a comprehensive pre-operative assessment to determine the most appropriate treatment approach for their specific condition.
