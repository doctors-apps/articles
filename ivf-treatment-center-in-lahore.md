##IVF Treatment Center In Lahore

IVF treatment, offered at IVF treatment centers in Lahore, is a form of assisted reproductive technology where fertilization takes place outside the body. The process involves retrieving eggs from the ovaries and fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory dish. This fertilized egg, now called an embryo, is then transferred back into the uterus to achieve pregnancy. IVF is used to treat various infertility issues such as blocked fallopian tubes, low sperm count, or unexplained infertility. The treatment center in Lahore provides comprehensive care to individuals or couples seeking to start a family through IVF, including counseling, testing, procedures, and support throughout the process.
