## Types of Hair Transplant

There are two main types of hair transplant procedures: follicular unit transplantation (FUT) and follicular unit extraction (FUE). In FUT, a strip of hair-bearing skin is removed from the back of the scalp and individual hair follicles are transplanted to the balding areas. This method leaves a linear scar but is often more cost-effective for large areas of hair loss. FUE involves extracting individual hair follicles from the donor area and implanting them in the recipient area without the need for a linear incision, resulting in minimal scarring and quicker recovery time. Both methods can provide natural-looking results and are popular choices for hair restoration.
