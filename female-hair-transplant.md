## Female Hair Transplant

Female hair transplants are a surgical procedure where hair follicles are moved from one part of the body to the scalp to promote hair growth. This treatment is commonly used to address conditions such as female pattern baldness, thinning hair, or alopecia. The procedure can help women improve the density and fullness of their hair, restoring confidence and self-esteem. It typically involves extracting hair follicles from a donor site, usually the back of the head, and implanting them into areas where hair loss or thinning has occurred. Results are usually permanent and natural-looking, making hair transplants a popular option for women seeking to combat hair loss.
