## hair transplant clinic in Chandigarh

A hair transplant clinic in Chandigarh offers a surgical procedure to treat hair loss by transplanting hair follicles from a donor site to the recipient area on the scalp. This procedure is commonly used to restore hair in areas where balding or thinning has occurred. The surgery involves harvesting hair follicles from the back or sides of the head, known as the donor area, and then implanting them into the balding or thinning areas. The transplanted hair follicles will continue to grow naturally, providing a permanent solution to hair loss. The clinic in Chandigarh may offer various techniques such as Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) or Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) to cater to different needs of the patients. It is important to consult with a qualified and experienced hair transplant specialist to determine the most suitable treatment plan for your specific condition.
