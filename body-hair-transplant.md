## Body Hair Transplant

Body hair transplant is a cosmetic procedure that involves transferring hair from one part of the body, usually the chest, back, or legs, to areas of the scalp that are experiencing hair loss. This technique is typically used in cases where traditional hair transplant methods using hair from the scalp are not feasible due to limited donor supply or poor hair quality. During the procedure, individual hair follicles are extracted from the body and implanted into the scalp using similar methods as traditional hair transplants. While body hair transplant may offer a solution for individuals with limited donor hair on their scalp, it is important to consult with a qualified and experienced surgeon to determine if this procedure is suitable and safe for each individual case.
