## Combined Approach Tympanoplasty

Combined approach tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure performed to repair a perforation or retraction of the eardrum and to improve hearing loss. The surgery involves a combination of approaches, including both the endoscopic and microscopic techniques, to provide the surgeon with better visibility and access to the middle ear structures. This approach allows for a more thorough and precise reconstruction of the eardrum, ossicles, and other middle ear components, leading to improved hearing outcomes and a higher success rate. Overall, combined approach tympanoplasty is a comprehensive treatment option for restoring the function of the middle ear and improving hearing in patients with perforated eardrums.

1) Combined approach tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure used to repair a perforated eardrum and improve hearing loss by combining two different techniques   the medial approach and the lateral approach.
2) In the medial approach, the surgeon makes an incision behind the ear and approaches the eardrum from the inside, while in the lateral approach, the surgeon approaches the eardrum through the ear canal.
3) By combining both approaches, the surgeon can effectively address complex cases of eardrum perforation and achieve better outcomes.
4) This technique is particularly useful for patients with severe or extensive ear pathology, such as large perforations, previous failed surgeries, or cholesteatoma.
5) The surgery is typically performed under general anesthesia and requires careful assessment of the patient's ear condition and hearing function beforehand.
6) During the procedure, the surgeon will carefully remove any diseased tissue, repair the perforation with graft material, and reconstruct the middle ear structures if needed.
7) The success rate of combined approach tympanoplasty is generally high, with most patients experiencing improved hearing and a reduced risk of recurrent ear infections.
8) Recovery from the surgery may vary depending on the individual case, but patients are usually advised to avoid water contact in the ear and follow post operative care instructions to promote healing.
