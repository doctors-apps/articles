##Orthopedic Implants

Orthopedic implants are devices surgically placed within the body to repair or replace damaged bone or joints. These implants are designed to provide stability, support, and alignment to facilitate healing and restore function. Common types of orthopedic implants include plates, screws, rods, and joint replacement components. The surgical procedure involves precise placement of the implant to ensure proper alignment and function, followed by a period of rehabilitation to promote healing and recovery. This treatment is commonly used for fractures, joint degeneration, and other orthopedic conditions to improve mobility and reduce pain.
