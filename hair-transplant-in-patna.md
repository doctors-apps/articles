## Hair Transplant in Patna

Hair transplant is a surgical procedure in which hair follicles are moved from one part of the body (donor site) to a balding or thinning area (recipient site) on the scalp. In Patna, hair transplant surgery is commonly performed to address male pattern baldness and female pattern baldness. The procedure involves extracting healthy hair follicles from the back or sides of the head, which are genetically resistant to balding, and transplanting them to areas of hair loss. This treatment can provide natural-looking results and long-lasting hair growth, ultimately improving the patient's confidence and appearance. It is important to consult with a qualified and experienced hair transplant surgeon in Patna to discuss the best approach for your specific needs.
