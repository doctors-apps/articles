## Gynecomastia Laser Surgery

Gynecomastia laser surgery is a minimally invasive procedure that involves the use of laser technology to remove excess breast tissue in men with gynecomastia, a condition characterized by the enlargement of male breast tissue. During the procedure, the laser is used to target and destroy the excess tissue while minimizing damage to surrounding areas. This approach typically results in less scarring, shorter recovery time, and reduced risk of complications compared to traditional surgical methods. Gynecomastia laser surgery may be a suitable option for individuals seeking a more precise and less invasive treatment for gynecomastia.
