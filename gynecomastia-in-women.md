## Gynecomastia in Women

Gynecomastia in women, also known as mammary gland hypertrophy, is the enlargement of breast tissue in females. Treatment for gynecomastia in women typically involves surgical intervention, such as breast reduction surgery. During the surgery, excess glandular tissue and fat are removed from the breasts to reduce their size and improve their shape. This procedure is often performed by a board-certified plastic surgeon and can help alleviate physical discomfort and improve the patient's self-image and confidence. Prior to undergoing surgery, it is important for individuals to consult with a healthcare professional to discuss their options and determine the most appropriate treatment plan for their specific needs.
