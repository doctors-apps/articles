## Gynecomastia Surgery in Chennai

Gynecomastia surgery in Chennai is a surgical procedure aimed at reducing excess male breast tissue. This condition, commonly known as "man boobs," can be caused by hormone imbalances, genetics, obesity, or certain medications. The surgery involves liposuction to remove fat and glandular tissue from the chest area, resulting in a flatter, more masculine chest contour. Board-certified plastic surgeons in Chennai perform this procedure with a focus on achieving natural-looking results and improving the patient's self-confidence. Prior to the surgery, a detailed consultation will be conducted to assess the individual's health and determine the best approach for their specific needs.
