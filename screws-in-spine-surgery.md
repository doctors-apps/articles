## Screws in Spine Surgery

In spine surgery, screws are often used to stabilize and support the spine during procedures such as spinal fusion. The screws are typically placed into the vertebrae and connected to rods or plates to fixate the spine in a desired position. This hardware helps to promote spinal alignment, correct deformities, and enhance the healing process. Surgeons use screws in spine surgery to provide stability, support, and alignment to the spine, ultimately aiming to relieve pain, improve mobility, and restore function for the patient.
