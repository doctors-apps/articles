## Types Of Myringoplasty

Myringoplasty is a surgical procedure aimed at repairing a perforated eardrum. There are several types of myringoplasty techniques, including the underlay technique where a graft is placed under the eardrum, the overlay technique where a graft is placed over the eardrum, and the combined approach technique which uses a combination of both underlay and overlay methods. The choice of technique depends on the size and location of the perforation, as well as the surgeon's preference and expertise. The goal of myringoplasty is to improve hearing, prevent recurrent infections, and restore the integrity of the eardrum.

1) Tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure that repairs a perforated eardrum. There are several types of myringoplasty, which is a specific type of tympanoplasty that focuses on repairing the eardrum.
2) Underlay myringoplasty: In this technique, the graft material is placed under the eardrum to repair the perforation. The graft is tucked underneath the edges of the eardrum, allowing it to heal and close the hole.
3) Overlay myringoplasty: This technique involves placing the graft material over the eardrum perforation. The graft is secured in place with surgical glue or stitches, allowing the eardrum to heal and seal the hole.
4) Underlay Overlay myringoplasty: This technique combines aspects of both underlay and overlay myringoplasty. The graft material is placed both under and over the eardrum perforation to ensure complete coverage and support.
5) Fascia graft myringoplasty: In this procedure, a thin piece of tissue called fascia is used as the graft material to repair the eardrum. The fascia is harvested from the patient's own body or can be obtained from a tissue donor.
6) Cartilage graft myringoplasty: This technique involves using a small piece of cartilage as the graft material to repair the eardrum. The cartilage provides structural support and helps to reinforce the repaired eardrum.
7) Fat plug myringoplasty: In this approach, a small piece of the patient's own fat tissue is used as the graft material to close the eardrum perforation. The fat plug promotes natural healing and tissue regeneration in the area.
8) Paper patch myringoplasty: This is a less invasive form of myringoplasty where a temporary paper patch is placed over the eardrum perforation. The paper patch helps to promote healing and often naturally falls off as the eardrum repairs itself.

9) Laser assisted myringoplasty: This advanced technique involves using a laser to precisely repair the eardrum perforation. The laser helps to create a clean and precise hole for the graft material to be placed.
10) Canalplasty myringoplasty: In cases where there is a narrow ear canal or scarring that hinders the myringoplasty procedure, a canalplasty may be performed. This involves widening the ear canal to facilitate the myringoplasty and improve the chances of a successful outcome.
Overall, the goal of myringoplasty is to restore the integrity of the eardrum, improve hearing, and prevent recurrent ear infections. The specific type of myringoplasty performed will depend on the location and size of the eardrum perforation, as well as the individual patient's anatomy and needs. After the procedure, patients are typically advised to avoid water entry into the ear and follow post operative care instructions to promote healing and optimal outcomes.
