## Mis Tlif Surgery

Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS TLIF) surgery is a procedure used to treat conditions such as degenerative disc disease, herniated discs, or spinal instability. During the surgery, the surgeon makes small incisions and uses specialized instruments to access the spine, removing the damaged disc and fusing the vertebrae together with a bone graft. This minimally invasive approach can result in less blood loss, reduced post-operative pain, and faster recovery compared to traditional open surgery techniques. However, as with any surgical procedure, there are potential risks and complications that should be discussed with a healthcare provider.
