## Microscopic Surgery of Spine

Microscopic spine surgery, also known as minimally invasive spine surgery, is a surgical technique performed to treat various conditions affecting the spine, such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and spinal tumors. This approach utilizes specialized instruments and a high-powered microscope to visualize and access the spine through small incisions, resulting in reduced trauma to surrounding tissues, less postoperative pain, and a quicker recovery time compared to traditional open surgery. By providing enhanced precision and magnification, microscopic spine surgery allows surgeons to effectively address spinal issues while minimizing damage to healthy tissue, offering patients a less invasive and more efficient option for treatment.
