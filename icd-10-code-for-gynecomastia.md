## ICD 10 code for Gynecomastia

The ICD-10 code for gynecomastia is N62. Gynecomastia treatment often involves a combination of medication, surgery, and lifestyle changes. Surgical options for gynecomastia may include liposuction or gland excision to remove excess breast tissue. Liposuction is used to remove excess fat, while gland excision involves the surgical removal of glandular tissue. The specific treatment approach will depend on the underlying cause and severity of the condition, and is typically determined by a healthcare provider following a thorough evaluation.
