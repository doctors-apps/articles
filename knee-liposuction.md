## Knee Liposuction

Knee liposuction is a cosmetic surgical procedure aimed at removing excess fat deposits from the knees to create a more contoured and streamlined appearance. During the procedure, a small incision is made near the knee area, and a thin tube called a cannula is inserted to suction out the fat cells. This can help to enhance the overall shape of the legs and improve the proportion of the knee area with the rest of the body. However, it is important to consult with a qualified plastic surgeon to determine if knee liposuction is the right option for achieving one's aesthetic goals and to understand the potential risks and recovery process associated with the procedure.
