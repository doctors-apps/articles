##Intrauterine Insemination Treatment

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) treatment, also known as artificial insemination, is a fertility treatment method where prepared sperm is directly inserted into a woman's uterus during her ovulation period to increase the chances of fertilization. This procedure is commonly used for couples experiencing infertility due to issues like low sperm count, cervical mucus problems, or unexplained infertility. IUI is a relatively simple and non-invasive procedure that can be done in a doctor's office, providing a more targeted approach to conception compared to natural intercourse. It can be a helpful option for couples seeking to conceive with medical assistance.
