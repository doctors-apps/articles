## Beard Hair for Hair Transplant

Beard hair is increasingly being used as a donor source in hair transplant procedures for individuals with limited scalp hair donor availability. The technique, known as body hair transplantation or BHT, involves extracting healthy hair follicles from the beard area and implanting them into balding or thinning areas of the scalp. Beard hair is commonly utilized in cases where traditional donor areas have been depleted or are not suitable for transplantation. This method can offer a viable solution for individuals seeking natural-looking hair restoration and can be tailored to suit each patient's unique needs and goals.
