## Overlay Vs Underlay Tympanoplasty

Tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure performed to repair a perforated eardrum. In overlay tympanoplasty, graft material is placed on top of the existing eardrum to repair the hole, while in underlay tympanoplasty, the graft material is placed underneath the remaining eardrum tissue. Overlay tympanoplasty is commonly used in cases of small perforations or where there is healthy tissue surrounding the hole, while underlay tympanoplasty is preferred for larger perforations or when the remaining eardrum tissue is not healthy enough to support a graft. The choice between overlay and underlay techniques depends on the size and characteristics of the perforation, as well as the surgeon's preference and experience.

1) In overlay tympanoplasty, the graft material is placed over the drum remnant, while in underlay tympanoplasty, the graft material is placed under the drum remnant.
2) Overlay tympanoplasty is typically preferred when the drum remnant is present and sufficiently healthy to support the graft, while underlay tympanoplasty is chosen when the drum remnant is not adequate for grafting.
3) Both procedures are commonly performed to repair a perforated eardrum and restore hearing function.
4) In overlay tympanoplasty, the graft is placed on top of the eardrum remnant, allowing for direct contact with the residual tympanic membrane.
5) In underlay tympanoplasty, the graft is tucked underneath the eardrum remnant to promote optimal healing and adherence of the graft.
6) Success rates for both overlay and underlay tympanoplasty are generally high, with patients experiencing improved hearing and decreased risk of recurrent ear infections.
7) Factors such as the size and location of the perforation, extent of middle ear disease, and surgeon preference may influence the choice between overlay and underlay techniques.
8) Post operative care for both procedures includes keeping the ear dry and avoiding activities that could introduce bacteria or irritants into the ear canal.

9) Patients may experience temporary discomfort, hearing changes, or ear pressure following surgery, which should subside as the ear heals.
10) Follow up appointments with an otolaryngologist are essential to monitor healing progress and ensure optimal outcomes following overlay or underlay tympanoplasty procedures.
