##Intrauterine Insemination Catheter

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a fertility treatment that involves placing sperm directly into a woman's uterus to facilitate fertilization. During the procedure, an intrauterine insemination catheter is used to carefully inject washed and prepared sperm into the uterus, increasing the chances of sperm reaching the egg for conception. This minimally invasive procedure is typically used for couples with unexplained infertility, mild male factor infertility, or cervical issues, and is often performed in combination with ovulation induction medication to optimize the chances of successful conception.
