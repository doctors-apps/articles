## Unilateral Gynecomastia

Unilateral gynecomastia is a condition characterized by the enlargement of one breast in males. Treatment for unilateral gynecomastia typically involves surgical intervention to correct the asymmetry and restore a more balanced appearance. The surgical procedure may involve liposuction, glandular tissue excision, or a combination of both, depending on the specific needs of the patient. The goal of surgery is to remove excess breast tissue and fat, sculpt the chest for a more natural contour, and achieve symmetry between the two breasts. Prior to undergoing surgery, a thorough evaluation by a qualified plastic surgeon is recommended to determine the most suitable treatment approach for the individual.
