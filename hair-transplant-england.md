## hair transplant England

Hair transplant surgery in England involves the surgical transfer of hair follicles from areas of dense hair growth to areas of baldness or thinning hair. This procedure is typically performed under local anesthesia and can help restore a natural-looking hairline and improve overall hair density. The two most common types of hair transplant techniques used in England are follicular unit extraction (FUE) and follicular unit transplantation (FUT). FUE involves individually extracting hair follicles from the donor area and implanting them in the recipient area, while FUT involves harvesting a strip of scalp from which hair follicles are dissected and transplanted. Hair transplant surgery in England is a safe and effective way to address hair loss and improve confidence and self-esteem.
