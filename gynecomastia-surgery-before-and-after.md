## Gynecomastia Surgery Before and After

Gynecomastia surgery, also known as male breast reduction surgery, is a procedure designed to reduce the excess breast tissue in men with enlarged breasts. Before the surgery, a comprehensive consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon is necessary to evaluate the extent of gynecomastia and discuss the desired outcome. During the surgery, excess breast tissue is removed through techniques like liposuction and surgical excision. After the surgery, patients can expect a more proportionate chest contour, improved self-confidence, and reduced discomfort associated with gynecomastia. The results of gynecomastia surgery are typically long-lasting, with proper post-operative care and healthy lifestyle habits crucial to maintaining the outcome.
