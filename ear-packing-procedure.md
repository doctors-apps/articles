## Ear Packing Procedure

Ear packing is a procedure used after ear surgery to help support the healing process and protect the surgical site. During the ear packing procedure, special gauze or other materials are placed inside the ear canal to absorb any fluids, prevent infection, and provide support to the delicate ear structures. This packing is typically removed by a healthcare provider after a few days to a week, depending on the specific case. The procedure is essential for ensuring proper healing and reducing the risk of complications following ear surgery.
