## Endoscopic Discectomy Surgery

Endoscopic discectomy surgery is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat herniated discs in the spine. During the surgery, a tiny camera (endoscope) is inserted through a small incision in the back, allowing the surgeon to visualize and remove the damaged portion of the disc. This approach typically results in less pain, faster recovery, and reduced risk of complications compared to traditional open surgery. Endoscopic discectomy surgery is often recommended for patients with persistent back or leg pain caused by a herniated disc that does not respond to conservative treatments like physical therapy or medication. It can effectively relieve pressure on the nerves and restore function in the affected area.
