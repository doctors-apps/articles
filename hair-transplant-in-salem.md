## hair transplant in Salem

Hair transplant in Salem is a surgical procedure that involves moving hair follicles from one part of the scalp (donor area) to areas experiencing hair loss or thinning (recipient area). This technique is commonly used to treat male pattern baldness and other types of alopecia. The procedure is typically performed under local anesthesia and can vary in duration depending on the extent of the hair loss. Results can take several months to become noticeable as the transplanted hair follicles settle and start to grow. It is important to consult with a qualified and experienced hair transplant surgeon in Salem to assess your candidacy for the procedure and to ensure realistic expectations regarding the outcome.
