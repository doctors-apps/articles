##IUI Treatment Success Rate

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a common fertility treatment where sperm is directly injected into a woman's uterus to facilitate fertilization. The success rate of IUI treatment varies depending on factors such as age, underlying infertility issues, and the individual's overall health. On average, the success rate of IUI ranges from 10% to 20% per cycle, with higher success rates seen in cases where there are no underlying fertility issues. It is essential for individuals undergoing IUI to consult with a fertility specialist to understand their specific chances of success based on their unique circumstances.
