##ICSI IVF Treatment

Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a specialized form of in vitro fertilization (IVF) where a single sperm is directly injected into an egg to assist with fertilization. This procedure is typically used when there are male factor infertility issues, such as low sperm count or poor sperm motility. ICSI can improve the chances of fertilization and successful embryo development, making it a valuable option for couples struggling with infertility. The process involves stimulating the ovaries to produce multiple eggs, retrieving the eggs, collecting a sperm sample, and then injecting a selected sperm into each mature egg. The resulting embryos are then transferred back into the woman's uterus for potential implantation and pregnancy.
