##Orthopedic Physical Therapy

Orthopedic physical therapy is a specialized branch of physical therapy that focuses on the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of musculoskeletal injuries and conditions affecting the muscles, joints, ligaments, and bones. Orthopedic physical therapists work with patients to develop individualized treatment plans aimed at reducing pain, improving mobility, and restoring function. Treatment may include therapeutic exercises, manual therapy techniques, and modalities such as ultrasound or electrical stimulation. In cases where conservative treatments are not effective, orthopedic surgery may be recommended to repair or reconstruct damaged tissues. Surgery is typically followed by a comprehensive physical therapy program to help patients recover strength, function, and mobility post-operatively.
