## Gastric Band Surgery NHS

Gastric band surgery, also known as adjustable gastric banding, is a surgical procedure commonly performed within the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK to help individuals with obesity lose weight. The surgery involves placing a silicone band around the upper part of the stomach to create a smaller stomach pouch, which restricts the amount of food a person can eat. This leads to feelings of fullness sooner, which in turn helps patients consume fewer calories and lose weight. The band is adjustable and can be tightened or loosened as needed. Gastric band surgery is typically recommended for individuals who have tried other weight loss methods without success and have a body mass index (BMI) above a certain threshold, as determined by medical guidelines. It is important to note that like any surgical procedure, gastric band surgery carries risks and potential complications, and patients must undergo thorough evaluations and post-operative care to ensure the best outcomes.
