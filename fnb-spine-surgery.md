## FNB Spine Surgery

FNB spine surgery, or foraminal and neuroforaminal bone surgery, is a minimally invasive procedure aimed at treating spinal conditions that cause nerve compression, such as herniated discs or bone spurs. During this surgery, the surgeon accesses the spine through small incisions and removes the source of compression, thereby relieving pain and restoring nerve function. FNB spine surgery typically results in shorter recovery times and less post-operative discomfort compared to traditional open surgeries, making it an attractive option for many patients seeking relief from spinal issues.
