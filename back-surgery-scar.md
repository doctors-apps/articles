## Back Surgery Scar

Treatment for back surgery scars typically involves non-invasive options like scar massage, silicone gel sheets, or corticosteroid injections to reduce the appearance of the scar. In some cases, surgical scar revision may be recommended to improve the appearance of the scar, which may involve removing the scar tissue and repositioning the skin to create a less noticeable scar. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment for your individual situation.
