## Spine Treatment Without Surgery

Spine treatment without surgery encompasses a range of non-invasive or minimally invasive approaches aimed at relieving pain and improving function in conditions such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis, or degenerative disc disease. This may include physical therapy, chiropractic care, acupuncture, medication, injections, or alternative therapies like yoga and massage. The goal is to address the underlying issues causing spine-related symptoms without the need for surgical intervention, providing patients with effective and less risky treatment options. It's essential to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the most suitable non-surgical approach based on individual needs and circumstances.
