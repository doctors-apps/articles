##Orthopedic Physiotherapy

Orthopedic physiotherapy is a specialized branch of physiotherapy that focuses on the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of musculoskeletal conditions and injuries affecting the bones, joints, muscles, ligaments, and tendons. Treatment often involves a combination of targeted exercises, manual therapy techniques, stretches, and modalities such as ultrasound or electrical stimulation to reduce pain, improve mobility, and restore function. In some cases, orthopedic surgery may be recommended to address severe or persistent issues, such as fractures, joint replacements, or ligament repairs, with physiotherapy playing a crucial role in post-operative rehabilitation to optimize recovery outcomes.
