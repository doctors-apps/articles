## SPINE NEURO

Spine neurosurgery, also known as spinal neurosurgery, is a specialized field within neurosurgery focused on the treatment of disorders affecting the spine and spinal cord. Common conditions that may require spine neurosurgery include herniated discs, spinal stenosis, spinal tumors, spinal fractures, and spinal deformities. Spine neurosurgery may involve various procedures such as discectomy, laminectomy, fusion surgery, and spinal instrumentation to alleviate pain, restore function, and stabilize the spine. These surgeries are often performed with minimally invasive techniques, leading to reduced recovery times and improved outcomes for patients. Spine neurosurgery aims to provide relief from debilitating spine conditions and improve the quality of life for individuals suffering from spinal disorders.
