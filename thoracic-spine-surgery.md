## Thoracic spine surgery

Thoracic spine surgery is a medical procedure performed to address issues or conditions affecting the thoracic region of the spine, which consists of the upper and middle sections. This type of surgery may be recommended for conditions such as herniated discs, spinal fractures, spinal deformities, tumors, or spinal stenosis in the thoracic region. The surgery aims to alleviate pain, improve stability, and restore function by removing damaged tissue, decompressing nerves, or stabilizing the spine with the use of internal hardware. The specific type of thoracic spine surgery will depend on the underlying condition and may involve techniques such as spinal fusion, laminectomy, discectomy, or vertebroplasty. Prior to surgery, patients will undergo a thorough evaluation and work closely with their healthcare team to determine the most appropriate course of treatment. Following surgery, rehabilitation and physical therapy may be recommended to aid in recovery and restore strength and mobility. It is essential for patients to follow post-operative care instructions and attend follow-up appointments to optimize their recovery and long-term outcomes.
