## Tympanoplasty Instruments

Tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure used to repair a perforated eardrum or damaged middle ear bones. During tympanoplasty surgery, various specialized instruments are used to access the middle ear, remove any diseased tissue, reconstruct the eardrum, and repair any defects in the middle ear bones. Some common instruments used in tympanoplasty include microscopes, otologic drills, myringotomy knives, and various types of surgical scissors and forceps. These instruments are essential in achieving a successful tympanoplasty procedure, which helps restore hearing and prevent recurrent ear infections.
