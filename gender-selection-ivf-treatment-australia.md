##Gender Selection IVF Treatment Australia

Gender selection in IVF treatment in Australia involves the use of pre-implantation genetic testing to select embryos of a desired gender before implanting them in the uterus. This process allows couples to choose the gender of their child for various reasons, such as medical, social, or personal preferences. It is important to note that gender selection is typically only permitted in Australia for medical reasons, such as genetic disorders linked to a specific gender. The process involves creating embryos through IVF, testing them for gender, and then selecting and implanting embryos of the desired gender.
