## Spinal Fixation

Spinal fixation is a surgical procedure used to stabilize the spine by reducing movement between vertebrae and promoting fusion of the spinal bones. This treatment is often recommended for conditions such as spinal fractures, deformities, or instability. During the procedure, screws, plates, rods, or cages are used to secure the vertebrae together, providing support and preventing further damage or misalignment. Spinal fixation surgery aims to improve spinal alignment, reduce pain, and restore function, allowing patients to experience better quality of life and mobility.
