## Grade 2 Gynecomastia

Grade 2 gynecomastia typically refers to a moderate level of male breast enlargement, where there is excess glandular tissue and fat present. Treatment options for grade 2 gynecomastia may include surgery, such as liposuction to remove excess fat and glandular tissue, along with possible excision of any remaining glandular tissue for a more defined chest contour. The specific approach to surgery can vary depending on the individual's needs and goals, and it is important to consult with a qualified plastic surgeon who specializes in gynecomastia treatment to determine the most suitable treatment plan for optimal results. After surgery, patients may be advised to wear a compression garment and follow post-operative care instructions to support healing and achieve the desired outcomes.
