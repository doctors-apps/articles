## Sleeve Gastrectomy Dubai

Sleeve gastrectomy in Dubai is a minimally invasive surgical weight loss procedure that involves reducing the size of the stomach by up to 85%, resulting in reduced food intake and a feeling of fullness. This procedure is often recommended for individuals who are severely obese and have not had success with other weight loss methods. By decreasing the size of the stomach, sleeve gastrectomy can help patients achieve significant weight loss and improve obesity-related health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea. The surgery is typically performed laparoscopically, leading to faster recovery times and less scarring compared to traditional open surgeries.
