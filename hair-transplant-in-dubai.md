## hair transplant in dubai

Hair transplant in Dubai is a cosmetic procedure that involves moving hair follicles from a donor area, typically the back of the scalp, to the balding or thinning areas. This procedure is usually performed under local anesthesia and can take several hours to complete, depending on the extent of the balding and the number of grafts needed. The results of hair transplant surgery are generally long-lasting, as the transplanted hair follicles are resistant to the hormone that causes hair loss. Patients may experience some minor discomfort and swelling post-surgery, but most can return to their normal activities within a few days. It is important to consult with a qualified and experienced surgeon in Dubai to determine if hair transplant is the right option for your individual needs.
