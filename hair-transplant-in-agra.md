## hair transplant in Agra

Hair transplant in Agra is a surgical procedure that involves transferring hair follicles from the donor area (usually the back or sides of the head) to the balding or thinning areas. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia and typically requires several hours depending on the extent of the hair loss. Once the transplanted hair follicles take root, they will continue to grow like natural hair, providing a long-term solution to balding or hair thinning. It is important to consult with a qualified and experienced hair transplant specialist in Agra to determine if you are a suitable candidate for the procedure and to discuss the expected results and potential risks involved.
