## Endoscopic Discectomy

Endoscopic discectomy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to treat herniated or bulging discs in the spine. The procedure involves inserting a small camera and specialized tools through a tiny incision to remove the damaged portion of the disc that is putting pressure on the nerves causing pain and other symptoms. Compared to traditional open surgery, endoscopic discectomy typically results in less tissue damage, reduced pain, shorter recovery times, and a lower risk of complications. It is considered a safe and effective treatment option for patients suffering from disc-related back or leg pain.
