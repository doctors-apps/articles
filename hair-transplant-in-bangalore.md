## Hair Transplant in Bangalore

Hair transplant in Bangalore is a surgical procedure where hair follicles are moved from a donor area, typically the back or sides of the head, to areas where hair loss has occurred. This procedure is commonly used to treat male pattern baldness, but it can also help with other types of hair loss. In Bangalore, hair transplant surgeries are performed by experienced and skilled doctors using advanced techniques such as Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) or Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT). Patients can expect natural-looking results and minimal scarring with proper post-operative care.
