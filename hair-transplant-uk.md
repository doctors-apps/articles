## Hair Transplant UK

Hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves moving hair follicles from one part of the body, known as the donor site (often the back or sides of the scalp), to balding or thinning areas, known as the recipient site. In the UK, hair transplant surgeries are commonly performed by specialized hair restoration clinics or surgeons and can help individuals regain a natural-looking full head of hair. The procedure is typically done under local anesthesia and can take several hours to complete, depending on the extent of hair loss and the desired results. Patients may experience some temporary discomfort and swelling post-surgery, but the transplanted hair follicles will eventually grow and provide long-lasting results.
