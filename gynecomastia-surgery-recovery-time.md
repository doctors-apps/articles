## Gynecomastia Surgery Recovery Time

Gynecomastia surgery is a cosmetic procedure performed to reduce the excess breast tissue in males. The recovery time after gynecomastia surgery can vary depending on the individual and the extent of the surgery. In general, patients can expect some swelling, bruising, and discomfort for the first few days after surgery. Most individuals can resume light activities within a week, but strenuous exercise should be avoided for about 4-6 weeks. It is important to follow post-operative care instructions provided by the surgeon to ensure a smooth recovery and optimal results.
