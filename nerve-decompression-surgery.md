## Nerve Decompression Surgery

Nerve decompression surgery is a procedure designed to alleviate pressure on a nerve that is causing pain or discomfort. This surgery involves removing tissue or bone that is compressing the nerve, allowing it to function properly and reducing symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or weakness. Nerve decompression surgery may be recommended for conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome or cubital tunnel syndrome, where nerves in the wrist or elbow are compressed. It is considered a relatively safe and effective option for patients who have not found relief with other treatments.
