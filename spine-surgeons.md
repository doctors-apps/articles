## Spine Surgeons

Spine surgeons are medical professionals specialized in the surgical treatment of conditions affecting the spine, such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and spinal deformities. They perform a range of surgical procedures aimed at relieving pain, stabilizing the spine, and improving mobility. Common surgeries include spinal fusion, discectomy, laminectomy, and decompression. Spine surgeons work closely with patients to determine the most appropriate treatment plan based on the individual's condition and overall health. Post-operative care and rehabilitation are also integral to the recovery process to ensure optimal outcomes for the patient.
