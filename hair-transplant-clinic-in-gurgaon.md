## Hair Transplant Clinic in Gurgaon

Hair transplant is a surgical procedure in which hair follicles are moved from a donor site on the body to the balding or thinning areas on the scalp. In Gurgaon, there are several clinics offering hair transplant services with skilled specialists and state-of-the-art technology. The procedure typically involves extracting hair follicles from the back or sides of the scalp (donor area) and implanting them into the balding areas (recipient area) to create natural-looking results. Patients often experience improved hair density and coverage after the procedure, with minimal scarring and downtime. It is important to consult with a qualified hair transplant specialist in Gurgaon to assess your candidacy and discuss the best treatment plan for achieving your desired results.
