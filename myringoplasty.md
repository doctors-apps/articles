## Myringoplasty

Myringoplasty is a surgical procedure performed to repair a perforation or hole in the eardrum. During the procedure, the surgeon typically takes a graft of tissue, often from the patient's own body or a synthetic material, and uses it to patch the hole in the eardrum. This surgery aims to restore hearing, prevent recurrent infections, and improve the overall health of the ear. Myringoplasty is usually performed under general anesthesia and has a high success rate with minimal risks or complications. After the surgery, patients may need follow-up appointments to monitor their healing progress and ensure the eardrum is properly repaired.

5) The surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia or local anesthesia with sedation.
