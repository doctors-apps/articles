##Free IVF Treatment In South Africa

In South Africa, free IVF treatment is available for qualifying individuals through the public health system. IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) is a fertility treatment that involves retrieving eggs from a woman's ovaries and fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory to create embryos, which are then transferred to the woman's uterus. These services are provided at select public hospitals and fertility clinics as part of the government's efforts to support couples who are struggling with infertility. Eligibility criteria may vary, but generally, individuals must meet specific medical, age, and financial requirements to access free IVF treatment in South Africa.
