The clinic will assess each patient's needs and goals to tailor a treatment plan that best suits their individual situation. Patients can expect to see gradual and permanent results as the transplanted hair follicles continue to grow in the treated areas. It is important for individuals considering a hair transplant to consult with a qualified medical professional at the clinic to determine if they are suitable candidates for the procedure and to discuss the potential risks and benefits.
