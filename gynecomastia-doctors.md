## Gynecomastia Doctors

Gynecomastia, a condition characterized by the enlargement of male breast tissue, can be treated effectively through surgery by skilled gynecomastia doctors. The surgical procedure typically involves the removal of excess glandular tissue and fat through techniques such as liposuction or excision. Depending on the severity of gynecomastia, the doctor may also perform skin tightening to ensure a more contoured chest appearance. It is important to consult with a board-certified plastic surgeon specializing in gynecomastia treatment to determine the most suitable approach for your specific case.
