## Hair Transplant in Goa

Hair transplant in Goa is a surgical procedure that involves moving hair follicles from one part of the body (usually the back or sides of the head) to the balding or thinning areas. This procedure is commonly used to treat male pattern baldness and restore hair growth. During the surgery, a local anesthetic is applied to the scalp, and the surgeon carefully extracts individual hair follicles or strips of hair-bearing skin from the donor area before implanting them into the recipient area. Hair transplant in Goa is a safe and effective treatment option that can provide natural-looking results and long-lasting hair growth for those experiencing hair loss.
