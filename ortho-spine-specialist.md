## Ortho Spine Specialist

An ortho spine specialist is a medical professional who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions affecting the spine. This may involve non-surgical interventions such as physical therapy, medication, or injections, as well as surgical options for more serious cases like spinal fusion or discectomy. The treatment approach will depend on the specific condition and severity, with the goal of reducing pain, improving mobility, and enhancing overall quality of life for the patient. Prior to recommending surgery, the ortho spine specialist will typically exhaust conservative measures and work closely with the patient to develop a personalized treatment plan.
