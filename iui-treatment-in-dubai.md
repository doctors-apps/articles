##IUI Treatment In Dubai

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a type of fertility treatment offered in Dubai for couples struggling to conceive naturally. During the procedure, sperm is collected, processed, and then directly inserted into the woman's uterus to increase the chances of fertilization. IUI is often recommended for couples with unexplained infertility, mild male fertility issues, or cervical factor infertility. The treatment is relatively non-invasive and less expensive compared to other fertility treatments like IVF. It is important to consult with a fertility specialist in Dubai to determine if IUI is the right option for you and to discuss the success rates and potential risks associated with the procedure.
