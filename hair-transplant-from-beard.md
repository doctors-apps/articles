## Hair Transplant From Beard

Hair transplant from the beard, also known as facial hair transplant, is a procedure where hair follicles are taken from the beard or other parts of the body and transplanted onto the scalp to restore hair in areas affected by baldness or hair thinning. This treatment is suitable for individuals who may not have enough donor hair on the back of the head but have good quality hair on their beard or body. The procedure involves extracting individual hair follicles and transplanting them onto the scalp, where they grow and provide natural-looking hair coverage. The results are long-lasting, with the transplanted hair blending seamlessly with existing hair to create a fuller and more youthful appearance.
