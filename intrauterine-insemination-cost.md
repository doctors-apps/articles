##Intrauterine Insemination Cost

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a fertility treatment where sperm is directly inserted into a woman's uterus to increase the chances of fertilization. The cost of IUI can vary depending on location, clinic, additional services, and whether medications are needed. On average, the cost for one IUI treatment cycle can range from $300 to $1,000, with multiple cycles often required for success. Some insurance plans may cover a portion of the cost, so it's advisable to check with your provider. It's important to discuss all aspects of the IUI procedure, including costs, with your healthcare provider to make an informed decision.
