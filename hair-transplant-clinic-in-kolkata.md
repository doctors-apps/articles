## Hair Transplant Clinic in Kolkata

A hair transplant clinic in Kolkata offers surgical procedures that involve transferring hair follicles from a donor site to areas of the scalp where hair loss has occurred. The procedure is commonly used to treat pattern baldness and other types of hair loss. During the surgery, hair follicles are harvested from the donor site, typically the back or sides of the scalp, and implanted into the recipient site. The surgery is usually performed under local anesthesia and can take several hours to complete, depending on the extent of hair loss. After the procedure, patients can expect some redness, swelling, and scabbing in the treated areas, but these typically resolve within a few days to a week. With proper care and follow-up, patients can achieve natural-looking results and a fuller head of hair.
