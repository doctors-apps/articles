## Spine Endoscopy

Spine endoscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to diagnose and treat various spinal conditions such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and spinal tumors. During the procedure, a small tube with a camera is inserted into the spinal canal through a tiny incision, allowing the surgeon to visualize and access the affected area without the need for traditional open surgery. This technique often results in less pain, faster recovery, and reduced risk of complications compared to traditional spinal surgery, making it a popular choice for many patients with spinal issues.
