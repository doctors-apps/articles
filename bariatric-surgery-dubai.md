## Bariatric Surgery Dubai

Bariatric surgery in Dubai is a type of weight loss surgery that helps individuals with obesity lose weight by altering their digestive system. The procedure involves reducing the size of the stomach or rerouting the small intestine to limit the amount of food a person can eat and absorb. This surgery is recommended for individuals who have not been able to lose weight through diet and exercise alone and can lead to significant and sustainable weight loss, improved overall health, and a reduced risk of obesity-related diseases. It is important to consult with a qualified healthcare provider to determine if bariatric surgery is the right option for you.
