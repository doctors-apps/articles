## Lumbar Fixation Surgery

Lumbar fixation surgery is a procedure used to stabilize and secure the lower part of the spine, known as the lumbar region. This surgical intervention involves the insertion of specialized hardware such as screws, rods, and plates to immobilize and support the affected area. The goal of lumbar fixation surgery is to alleviate pain, correct spinal deformities, and improve the overall stability of the spine. This procedure is typically recommended for conditions such as spinal fractures, degenerative disc disease, scoliosis, or spinal instability. Patients undergoing lumbar fixation surgery often undergo a period of rehabilitation to regain strength and mobility post-surgery.
