##Insemination Meaning

Insemination refers to a medical procedure in which sperm is introduced into a woman's reproductive tract to facilitate fertilization and pregnancy. This procedure may be used to overcome fertility issues such as low sperm count or motility, or in cases where the woman's cervical mucus is hostile to sperm. Insemination can be done using the partner's sperm (intrauterine insemination) or donor sperm. It is a relatively simple and non-invasive procedure that can be performed in a doctor's office, offering a potential solution for couples struggling to conceive naturally.
