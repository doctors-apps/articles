## Hair Transplant in Shillong

Hair transplant surgery in Shillong involves taking hair follicles from one part of the scalp (usually the back or sides) where hair is abundant and transplanting them to areas where hair is thinning or balding. This procedure is carried out under local anesthesia in a clinic and typically takes several hours to complete. The transplanted hair will continue to grow naturally, providing a permanent solution to hair loss. It is important to consult with a qualified and experienced hair transplant surgeon in Shillong to discuss your specific needs and expectations before undergoing the procedure.
