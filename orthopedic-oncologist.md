##Orthopedic Oncologist

An orthopedic oncologist is a specialized medical professional who focuses on diagnosing and treating bone and soft tissue tumors, including cancerous tumors. Treatment may involve a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy to remove the tumor and prevent its spread. Surgery by an orthopedic oncologist aims to preserve function and mobility while ensuring the most effective removal of the tumor, often using techniques such as limb-sparing surgery or reconstructive procedures. The goal of treatment is to improve the patient's quality of life, alleviate symptoms, and achieve the best possible outcome in terms of controlling or eliminating the cancer.
