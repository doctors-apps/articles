## Spine Doctor

A spine doctor, or orthopedic surgeon specializing in spinal conditions, may recommend treatment options ranging from conservative approaches like physical therapy and medication to surgical interventions for more severe cases such as spinal fusion or disc replacement surgery. The goal of treatment is to alleviate pain, restore function, and improve quality of life for patients suffering from spine-related issues. Surgery is typically considered when non-surgical methods have been exhausted or when there is evidence of nerve compression or structural damage that requires intervention to stabilize the spine and prevent further deterioration. Prior to undergoing surgery, patients will undergo a thorough evaluation to determine the most appropriate course of action tailored to their specific condition and needs.
