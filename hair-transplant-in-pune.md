## Hair Transplant in Pune

Hair transplant in Pune is a surgical procedure that involves the transplantation of hair follicles from one part of the scalp to areas experiencing hair loss or thinning. The procedure is often performed under local anesthesia and typically involves extracting hair follicles from the back or sides of the scalp (donor area) and implanting them into the balding or thinning areas (recipient area). This treatment can help individuals regain a fuller, natural-looking head of hair and is considered a long-term solution for hair loss. In Pune, there are several reputable clinics and hair transplant specialists who offer this procedure using advanced techniques such as FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction) or FUT (Follicular Unit Transplantation).
