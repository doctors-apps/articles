##IUI Treatment Fertility

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a fertility treatment that involves placing washed and concentrated sperm directly into the uterus during the woman's ovulation period to increase the chances of fertilization. It is a relatively simple and less invasive procedure compared to other fertility treatments, making it a popular option for couples experiencing infertility due to various factors like low sperm count, cervical issues, or unexplained infertility. IUI can be done with or without fertility medications to stimulate ovulation, and it may be recommended for couples with mild fertility issues or as a first-line treatment before proceeding to more advanced procedures like in vitro fertilization (IVF).
