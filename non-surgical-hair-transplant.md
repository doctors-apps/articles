## Non Surgical Hair Transplant

Non-surgical hair transplant refers to the use of techniques like platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, low-level laser therapy (LLLT), and microneedling to promote hair growth and improve the appearance of thinning hair without undergoing invasive surgical procedures like follicular unit transplantation (FUT) or follicular unit extraction (FUE). PRP therapy involves using the patient's own blood to stimulate hair follicles, while LLLT uses laser light to enhance hair growth. Microneedling creates tiny wounds that stimulate healing and encourage hair regrowth. While non-surgical hair transplant methods may not provide the same dramatic results as surgical options, they can be a less invasive alternative for those seeking to improve the health and density of their hair.
