## Gynecomastia Surgery in Mumbai

Gynecomastia surgery, also known as male breast reduction surgery, is a cosmetic procedure designed to reduce excess breast tissue in men suffering from a condition called gynecomastia. In Mumbai, this surgery is performed by skilled plastic surgeons who can sculpt the chest to create a more masculine appearance by removing the excess fat and glandular tissue. The procedure typically involves liposuction and excision techniques based on the individual's needs. Patients can benefit from improved self-confidence and a more contoured chest following the surgery. It is important to consult with a qualified surgeon to determine if gynecomastia surgery is the right option for you.
