## What is a BACK SPECIALIST called

A back specialist who focuses on the treatment and surgical intervention of back conditions is called an orthopedic spine surgeon or a neurosurgeon specializing in spine surgery. These highly trained medical professionals evaluate and manage various spinal disorders such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis, fractures, and deformities. They can offer both surgical and non-surgical treatment options to address back pain and related issues, with the goal of improving patients' mobility and quality of life. Surgical procedures performed by back specialists may include spinal fusion, laminectomy, disc replacement, or other minimally invasive techniques to alleviate pain and restore spinal function. It is essential to consult with a qualified back specialist to determine the most suitable treatment plan based on an individual's specific condition and needs.
