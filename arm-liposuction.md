## Arm Liposuction

Arm liposuction is a cosmetic surgical procedure that involves the removal of excess fat from the arms to sculpt and contour them. During the procedure, a cosmetic surgeon makes small incisions in the targeted areas, inserts a thin tube called a cannula to extract the fat, and then gently sculpts and reshapes the arms to achieve a more toned appearance. Arm liposuction can help individuals achieve slimmer and more defined arms, improving their overall body proportions and boosting their self-confidence. It is important to consult with a qualified plastic surgeon to discuss the expectations, risks, and recovery process associated with arm liposuction.
