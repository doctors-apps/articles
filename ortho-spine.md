## Ortho Spine

Orthopedic spine treatment or surgery, also known as ortho spine treatment, involves procedures to address problems with the spine such as injuries, deformities, or degenerative conditions that cause pain and restrict mobility. These treatments can range from conservative measures like physical therapy, medication management, and injections to more invasive options like spinal fusion, disc replacement, or decompression surgery. The goal of ortho spine treatment is to relieve pain, improve function, and enhance the quality of life for individuals affected by spine issues. The specific treatment approach chosen will depend on the underlying condition, severity of symptoms, and individual patient factors, all of which will be carefully evaluated by a spine specialist to determine the most appropriate course of action.
