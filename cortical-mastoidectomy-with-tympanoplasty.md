## Cortical Mastoidectomy With Tympanoplasty

Cortical mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure that involves two main components. Cortical mastoidectomy is the removal of infected or damaged bone in the mastoid portion of the temporal bone to improve drainage and access for the treatment of conditions such as chronic ear infections or cholesteatoma. Tympanoplasty, on the other hand, involves reconstructing or repairing the eardrum and middle ear bones to improve hearing. The combination of these two procedures is often performed to treat persistent ear infections, restore hearing, and prevent future complications in patients with middle ear pathology.
