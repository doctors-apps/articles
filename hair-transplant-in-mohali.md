## Hair Transplant in Mohali

Hair transplant in Mohali is a surgical procedure that involves moving hair follicles from one part of the body (typically the back or sides of the head) to areas where hair is thinning or balding. This procedure is commonly used to treat male pattern baldness and can also be used for other types of hair loss. The process involves extracting hair follicles from the donor area and implanting them into the recipient area, where they will continue to grow hair naturally. Mohali is known for its skilled and experienced hair transplant surgeons who use advanced techniques such as FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction) or FUT (Follicular Unit Transplantation) to provide successful and natural-looking results for patients seeking to restore their hair growth.
