## Nerve Decompression

Nerve decompression surgery is a procedure performed to relieve pressure on a nerve that is compressed or pinched by surrounding tissues. This pressure on the nerve can lead to pain, tingling, numbness, weakness, or other symptoms in the affected area. During the surgery, the surgeon will identify the source of compression and release the pressure on the nerve, allowing it to function properly again. This procedure is commonly used to treat conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, and spinal stenosis, among others. Nerve decompression surgery can help alleviate symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life.
