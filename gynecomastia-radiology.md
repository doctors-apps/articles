## Gynecomastia Radiology

Gynecomastia, a condition characterized by the enlargement of male breast tissue, can be treated surgically for patients seeking a more permanent solution. During gynecomastia surgery, a plastic surgeon typically performs liposuction to remove excess fat and glandular tissue from the breasts. In some cases, excess skin may also be removed to create a more contoured and masculine chest appearance. The specific surgical approach may vary based on the severity of gynecomastia and individual patient needs, and it is important for patients to consult with a qualified plastic surgeon to determine the most appropriate treatment plan.
