## Hair Transplant for Women

Hair transplant for women is a surgical procedure in which hair follicles are moved from areas of the scalp where hair is plentiful to areas experiencing thinning or balding. This procedure is typically recommended for women with genetic hair loss, pattern baldness, or thinning hair due to hormonal changes. The surgeon extracts individual hair follicles from the back or sides of the scalp and implants them into the affected areas. Results can vary, but most women experience noticeable hair growth and improvement in overall density. It is important for women considering hair transplant to consult with a qualified surgeon to discuss expectations, candidacy, and potential risks or side effects.
