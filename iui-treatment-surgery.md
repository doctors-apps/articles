##IUI Treatment Surgery

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a fertility treatment where sperm is directly placed into a woman's uterus to increase the chances of fertilization. This procedure is often recommended for couples experiencing infertility due to a variety of reasons, such as low sperm count, cervical factor infertility, or unexplained infertility. IUI can be a less invasive and lower-cost option compared to other fertility treatments like IVF. Before the procedure, the woman may undergo ovulation induction to stimulate egg production. The sperm sample is washed and prepared in the lab before being inserted into the uterus using a thin catheter. IUI is usually a quick and relatively painless procedure performed in a doctor's office. After the procedure, patients may be advised to rest briefly before resuming normal activities. Success rates of IUI can vary depending on individual circumstances, but it can be a helpful option for couples struggling with infertility.
