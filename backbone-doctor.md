## Backbone Doctor

A "backbone doctor" is typically a spine specialist, such as an orthopedic surgeon or neurosurgeon, who specializes in diagnosing and treating conditions affecting the spine. Treatment may involve a combination of conservative approaches like physical therapy, medication, and injections, as well as surgical interventions when necessary. Backbone surgery may be recommended to address issues such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis, fractures, or deformities. The goal of backbone surgery is to alleviate pain, improve mobility, and restore function to the affected area of the spine. It is important to consult with a qualified spine specialist to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for your individual condition.
