## Gynecomastia Surgery Scars

Gynecomastia surgery, also known as male breast reduction surgery, aims to remove excess breast tissue in men. The surgical procedure may leave scars, which typically fade over time but could be permanent depending on the individual's skin type and how well they heal. Treatment for gynecomastia surgery scars may include scar management techniques such as silicone sheets, creams, or laser therapy to improve their appearance. In some cases, a scar revision surgery may be performed to minimize the visibility of the scars. It is essential to consult with a board-certified plastic surgeon to discuss the available options and determine the most suitable treatment plan for each specific case.
