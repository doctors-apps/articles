##Cost Of IUI Treatment

The cost of Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) treatment can vary depending on various factors such as location, clinic, medical professional fees, medications, and additional tests. On average, the cost for an IUI cycle can range from $300 to $1,000 per cycle, but this cost does not always include the cost of medications or pre-treatment testing. It is important to check with your healthcare provider and insurance company to understand what costs are covered and what additional expenses you may incur during the process. Some clinics offer package deals for multiple cycles, which can help to reduce the overall cost of IUI treatment.
