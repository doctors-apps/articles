## Hair Transplant in Jaipur

Hair transplant in Jaipur is a surgical procedure that involves moving hair follicles from a donor area, usually the back or sides of the head, to the balding or thinning areas. This procedure is commonly used to treat pattern baldness and is performed under local anesthesia. The results of a hair transplant can be permanent, as the transplanted hair follicles are resistant to the hormone that causes hair loss. Hair transplant in Jaipur is carried out by skilled and experienced surgeons, and the city offers various clinics and facilities that provide this procedure with high success rates and patient satisfaction.
