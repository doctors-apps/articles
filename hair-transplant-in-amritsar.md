## Hair Transplant in Amritsar

Hair transplant in Amritsar is a surgical procedure that involves moving hair follicles from one part of the body (often the back of the head) to the balding or thinning areas. This results in natural-looking hair growth in the recipient areas. The procedure is typically performed under local anesthesia and can take several hours depending on the extent of hair loss and the number of grafts needed. Some common types of hair transplants in Amritsar include Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) and Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT). It is important to consult with a qualified and experienced hair transplant surgeon in Amritsar to determine the best treatment plan for your individual needs.
