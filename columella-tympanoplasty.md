## Columella Tympanoplasty

Columella tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure used to repair a hole or perforation in the eardrum, also known as the tympanic membrane. During the procedure, a small piece of tissue, often taken from the patient's tragus or cartilage, is used to patch the hole in the eardrum. This surgery aims to improve hearing, prevent recurrent infections, and restore the proper functioning of the middle ear. Columella tympanoplasty is a common and effective treatment for patients with eardrum perforations and can significantly improve their quality of life.

1) Columella tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure performed to repair the perforation or hole in the eardrum (tympanic membrane) by using tissue from the patient's nasal septum as a graft.
2) This procedure is commonly indicated for patients with chronic ear infections, hearing loss, or other complications resulting from a perforated eardrum.
3) During the surgery, the surgeon makes an incision in the ear canal and carefully lifts the eardrum to access the perforation.
4) The graft tissue from the nasal septum is then placed over the perforation to close the hole and promote healing.
5) The graft is secured in place with special dissolvable materials or tiny stitches.
6) Columella tympanoplasty can often be performed under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis, allowing for a quicker recovery.
7) Following the surgery, patients may need to protect their ear from water and avoid activities that could increase pressure in the middle ear.
8) The success rate of columella tympanoplasty is generally high, with many patients experiencing improved hearing and a reduced risk of ear infections post surgery.
