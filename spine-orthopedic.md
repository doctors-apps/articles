## Spine Orthopedic

Spine orthopedic treatment often involves nonsurgical options such as physical therapy, medication, and injections to manage neck or back pain caused by conditions like herniated discs or spinal stenosis. When conservative measures are unsuccessful, spine orthopedic surgery may be recommended, which can include procedures like spinal fusion, laminectomy, or disc replacement to alleviate pain, stabilize the spine, and improve overall function. The goal of spine orthopedic treatment and surgery is to restore mobility, reduce pain, and enhance the quality of life for individuals with spine-related issues.
