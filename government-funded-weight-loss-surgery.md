## Government Funded Weight Loss Surgery

Government funded weight loss surgery refers to surgical procedures such as gastric bypass or gastric sleeve surgery that are covered or partially covered by the government for individuals who meet certain criteria, such as having a high body mass index (BMI) or weight-related health conditions. This type of surgery is often recommended for individuals who have not been successful in achieving weight loss through traditional methods such as diet and exercise, and can be a beneficial option for those looking to improve their overall health and quality of life. Access to government funded weight loss surgery may vary depending on the specific healthcare system and policies in place in a given country or region.
