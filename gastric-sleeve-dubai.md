## gastric sleeve dubai

Gastric sleeve surgery, also known as sleeve gastrectomy, is a minimally invasive weight-loss procedure that involves reducing the size of the stomach to help patients lose weight and improve their overall health. In Dubai, this procedure is performed by skilled bariatric surgeons at various healthcare facilities. It is often recommended for individuals with severe obesity or weight-related health issues who have not had success with other weight-loss methods. The surgery limits the amount of food the stomach can hold, leading to a feeling of fullness with smaller portions. Patients undergoing gastric sleeve surgery in Dubai can benefit from personalized care, advanced medical technology, and post-operative support to help them achieve their weight-loss goals and improve their quality of life.
